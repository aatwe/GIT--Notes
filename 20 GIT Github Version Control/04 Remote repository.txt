where is remote repository hosted? somebody else's server/computer
 


1) Create new repo
	+ -> Repositroy name -> Description -> 
		Public : everything we commit to remote repo/Github anyone can see
		Private  : needs subscription on github
	-> Create Repository


2) How many ways to setup repository?

	1) Github for desktop
	2) HTTPS/SSH
	3) Create repo on CLI
		 CLI Push existing local repo -> remote repo
			a) copy https address
				echo "# Story" >> README.md
				git init
				git add README.md
				git commit -m "first commit"
				git remote add origin https://github.com/angelabauer/Story.git
				git push -u origin master

		Ex we have 2 previous commits	//check by git log
		How to push these commits to github

		1)    Create remote repository
		       git remote add origin https://github.com/angelabauer/Story.git
						//origin = name of remote, can be any name
						//URL of remote repo on Github
		2)   Push changes from local to remote repository (-u links) (push to branch master)(master = default/main branch)
		      git push -u origin master		//uploading local repository to remote repositroy

						//Master branch = timeline of commits

		3) Refresh Github : Files are hosted on Github, check commit messages
			Insights -> Graphs -> Network
				Master branch with only 2 statements/commits
				On this branch see chekpoints


Now we have 4 repo

Wokring directory	Staging area	Local repo	Remote Repo
				.git		Github
Can local and repo run in parallel? Yes
how to sync them?	
Both local and remote have master branch
