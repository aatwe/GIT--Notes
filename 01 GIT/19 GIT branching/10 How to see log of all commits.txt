10 What if many different commits
when we have many different commits
for undoing multiple commits or getting back to specific commit

no quick pointer avail in GIT like HEAD to look at last commit


But
can see log of all commit
demo-repo git:(quick-test) x git log

//topmost is the latest
	each commit has commit message
	easy to track
	each commit has a hash for ex15181e.....
	scroll using spacebar	

demo-repo git:(quick-test) x git reset 15181e.......
//ANY CHANGES MADE TO FILE AFTER 1518e.... commit are now unstaged
//changes will still be there but they are not with GIT any longer
