pull code into other branch

for ex code from feature rbanch pull into master branch
make PR from feature branch to master branch


why make Pull request from one branch to other? so that anyone can review our code
						comment
						ask to make changes/update

How to update the code after making pullrequest?
Make additional commits in code and pushing up to github
	given it is on same branch as of PR

What after merging PR? delete feature/source branch switch back to master
			thenif we want to make coding changes 
			create another new branch
			start process over
				make commit 
				make pr 
				merge again

How to create pull request manually on github

1) Manually on github
when you push a new branch on github
//it asks if you want to compare and create a pullrequest


the compare branch is merged with the base branch
Add title and description of pull request
CREATE PULL REQUEST BUTTON

check comments made on pull request
check commits made 
check files changed
//can add comment at line of code as well
useful when multiple people commenting on code
//have to click resolve if not owner


MERGE PULL REQUEST

//our PR has merged successfully
how to check?

swtich to master branch
demo-repo git: (feature-readme-instructions) git checkout

checkcode //changes not present why? changes are on github
	need to pull them down form master branch


demo-repo git:(master) git pull origin master
//succesfully pulled from master branch
Check code agian
local master also gets updated with changes from branch 



//Now we delete the branch

//Check list of branches
demo-repo git:(master) git branch
feature-readme-instructions
*master

demo-repo git:(master) git branch
	//-d indicates deleting
demo-repo git:(master) git branch -d feature-readme-instructions
