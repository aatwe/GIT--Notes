master = default branch in repo
code lives on a branch

create new branch : feature

initially code on master branch = feature branch

but changes commited to feature branch -> not visible on master

each branch tracks itself only


why branching? to create new features that are not master ready yet
		we get a sandbox area beofre merging main branch

For ex
bug in commit#4 in main branch

How to bug fix?
 create hotfix branch after commit# 4 in main
 make change to fix bug
 merge into master branch
