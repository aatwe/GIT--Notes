Github => fork button in repo

What does fork do? make copy of repository
why fork? if you have full acceess to your own repo no need to fork it


for ex
vue.js repository on internet

we dont have accesss to change anything on here
if we want to make PR against repo or request for change to be added
or just branchoff the code and do whatever i want with it


Then click fork button and fork it to user account
vuejs repo is now under your personal github\
After forking we have complete control to make any update or changes to code
we can commit to any file -> commit to dev branch
	usually there are dev stage master
