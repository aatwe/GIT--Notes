demo repo2 folder
//this folder is not git repository yet , earlier we pushed local file that was in repository
this is new repo


//How to check if it is git repository? la //check hidden folder

for ex
add README.md and some text in local repo

//Convert local repo to git repo
git init
//check path of initialized repo

//Check
git status
	README.md //Untracked

//Track the untracked file
git add README.md
git status

//file read to commit

git commit -m "Created README" -m "description "

//How to push it live?
 git push origin master
//fatal error origin is not git repo  
why? we didnt clone this from git repo
	git doesnt know where to push it since it is not connected

How to create conenction for new local repo to git? How to add origin?

	git remote -v	//shows remote repo connected
//origin is now setup//connection to push is done

git push origin master 
//to make it default can also use
	git push -u origin master //in future will default origin master
