commit just moved changes to snapshot and save on gti
To push changes to github we need to connect local machine using ssh key
How to connect local machine to github account (trust by giving one key)
SSH Keys



How to generate local SSH key?
	 type of encryption
		strength of encryption
			email address for github	
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c "abc@gmail.com"

//Enter file to save the key in
	default: userdirectory/.ssh/id_rsa

//Enter passphrase for key:
	//can leave blank

//Key successfully generated

//Search for the key in directory by using ls

2 keys;
testkey		//private key	//keep secure onlocal machine
testkey.pub	//The key that we upload to github interface
		//public key

 we upload public key on github
whenever we want rto connect to github/push code to github/use account
	//private key will verify you are generator of public key

How to print out public key?
cat testkey.pub
//key will start with ssh-rsa end with email
Copy the entire public key
	//just highlighting will copy the text, no ned for ctrl + c
	//another way to copy = pbcopy <~/testkey.pub>

Go to github -> Settings -> SSH and GPG Keys
 -> New SSH key 
     a) title
     b) paste public key

Add SSH Key
Confirm Password 
Key is successfully added (trust connection made)


make sure local CLi knows about the key we generated?
//this will set p key to be working with GIT //General way for OS
How?
//Check ssh key image
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
 > Agent pid 59566
//public KEY IS SUCCESSGFULLY uploaded to github
